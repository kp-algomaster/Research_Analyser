# VS Code Extension — Research Analyser Integration
**Spec version:** 1.1
**Status:** Draft
**Depends on:** Research Analyser API (`research_analyser/api.py`), analysis output format (`AnalysisReport`)

---

## 1. Purpose

Bridge the gap between a research paper analysis and its software implementation.
When a developer builds code based on a paper, the Research Analyser extension surfaces
the paper's equations, methodology, key findings, and spec directly inside VS Code —
reducing context-switching between browser/PDF and editor.

### 1.1 Primary Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Equation reference while coding** | Hover over a symbol (`alpha`, `W_q`) to see its LaTeX definition from the paper |
| **Spec.md with live equations** | Open the generated `spec.md` and see LaTeX rendered inline, not raw `$...$` strings |
| **Research context sidebar** | Quick-access panel: abstract, methodology, score, key findings |
| **Equation insertion** | Pick an equation from the paper and insert it as a docstring/comment at cursor |
| **Trigger analysis from IDE** | Run Research Analyser on a PDF/URL without leaving VS Code |
| **Implementation coverage** | Tag functions/files as "implements §3.2" and see uncovered spec sections |

## 2. Architecture

```
VS Code Extension (TypeScript)
    ├── ResearchPanel         — WebviewPanel: full report viewer with rendered equations
    ├── EquationHoverProvider — HoverProvider: symbol → LaTeX tooltip
    ├── SpecDocumentProvider  — CustomTextEditorProvider: spec.md with inline equation renders
    ├── EquationPickerCommand — QuickPick: browse + insert equations as comments
    ├── AnalysisTriggerCommand— calls Research Analyser REST API, streams progress
    ├── CoverageDecorator     — gutter icons marking "implements §X.Y" annotations
    └── ReportStore           — singleton: holds loaded AnalysisReport JSON in memory

Research Analyser API (localhost:8000 or configurable)
    GET  /health
    POST /analyse          — triggers analysis, returns AnalysisReport JSON
    GET  /report/latest    — returns the most recent AnalysisReport JSON
    GET  /equations        — returns all extracted equations
```

### 2.1 Data Flow

```
User opens PDF / pastes URL
    → Extension calls POST /analyse (streams progress via SSE)
    → On completion: AnalysisReport stored in ReportStore
    → ResearchPanel, HoverProvider, SpecDocumentProvider all refresh from ReportStore
    → Equation symbols extracted → HoverProvider index built
    → spec.md (if generated) opened with equation decorations applied
```

## 5. Views & UI

### 5.1 Research Analyser Sidebar (Activity Bar icon)

```
RESEARCH ANALYSER                          [⟳ Analyse]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▸ Paper
    Title: Unifying Color and Lightness...
    Authors: Z. Cui, S. Liu, X. Dong...
    Score:  7.4 / 10  ● Weak Accept

▸ Abstract
    High-quality image acquisition in...

▸ Methodology
    We propose a View-Adaptive Curve...

▸ Key Findings  (3)
    🔴  Novel per-view curve adjustment
    🟡  Outperforms NeRF baselines by 2.1 dB
    🟡  Paper includes 14 key equations

▸ Equations  (14)
    eq-1  · Introduction
    eq-3  · Method
    eq-7  · Loss Function
    ...
```

TreeView with three root nodes: **Paper**, **Equations**, **Spec Sections**.
Clicking an equation node opens the ResearchPanel scrolled to that equation.

### 5.2 ResearchPanel (WebviewPanel)

Full interactive report rendered in a WebviewPanel:

- **Header**: paper title, authors, score badge (colour-coded)
- **Tabs**: Summary | Equations | Diagrams | Peer Review | Spec
- **Summary tab**: Abstract / Methodology / Results cards (same dark-card style as Streamlit UI)
- **Equations tab**: Each equation rendered via KaTeX, with:
  - `Copy LaTeX` button
  - `Insert as comment` button
  - Section tag chip
  - Description if available
- **Diagrams tab**: Generated diagram images (from `diagram.image_path`)
- **Peer Review tab**: Score bar, strengths/weaknesses, dimensional scores
- **Spec tab**: Full spec.md rendered as HTML with equations via KaTeX

Technology: VS Code Webview API, KaTeX (bundled, no CDN), VS Code theme CSS variables.

### 5.3 Equation Hover Provider

Activated for all languages (`.py`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.cpp`, `.rs`, etc.).

**Index build**: On `ReportStore` load, extract all symbols from equation LaTeX:
- Regex `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*` applied to each equation's `.latex` field
- Map symbol → list of `{ equationId, latex, label, section }` entries
- Also index camelCase splits: `queryWeight` → tries `W_q`, `W_{query}`

**Hover behaviour**:
```
User hovers over: alpha
  → Look up "alpha" in symbol index
  → Found in eq-4: \alpha = \text{learning rate}
  → Show hover card:
      ── Research Analyser ──────────────────
      **α** · eq-4 · §3 Method

      $$\alpha = \frac{\eta_0}{1 + \lambda t}$$

      Learning rate schedule for curve optimizer.
      [Copy LaTeX]  [Show in Panel]
```

Hover renders LaTeX as an SVG via KaTeX (server-side via a bundled Node.js helper, or via the Webview engine).

### 5.4 Spec Document Provider (spec.md)

When VS Code opens any file named `spec.md` or `*_spec.md`, the extension provides a custom split view:

- **Left pane**: Standard text editor (editable markdown)
- **Right pane**: Live-rendered preview with KaTeX equations
  `$...$` and `$$...$$` blocks are rendered, not displayed as raw text

This is implemented as a `CustomTextEditorProvider` registering for `**/spec.md` and `**/*_spec.md` glob patterns.

Equation blocks from the loaded AnalysisReport are also shown as **inline decorations** in the text editor pane:
- After a line containing `## Equations` or `### eq-N`, a small rendered preview is injected as a VS Code decoration (right-aligned, muted)

### 5.5 Equation Picker (QuickPick)

`⇧⌘Q` opens a QuickPick list:

```
Search equations…
─────────────────────────────────────────────
  eq-1  §Introduction   $ y = f(x; \theta) $
  eq-3  §Method         $ \mathcal{L} = ... $
  eq-7  §Loss           $ L_{total} = ... $
  …
```

On selection, user chooses insert format:
- `# $$...$$ (comment block)`
- `"""LaTeX: ...""" (docstring)`
- `Raw LaTeX string`

Equation inserted at cursor position in the active editor.

## 6. Analysis Trigger Flow

```
User: ⇧⌘R → "Research Analyser: Analyse Paper"
  → Input box: "PDF path, URL, arXiv ID, or DOI"
  → User enters: "2405.12345" (arXiv)
  → Extension calls: POST http://localhost:8000/analyse
    Body: { "source": "2405.12345", "options": { ... } }
  → VS Code notification: "Analysing paper…"
  → Progress notification with live message updates (SSE stream or polling GET /progress)
  → On completion: ReportStore.load(report)
  → ResearchPanel opens/refreshes
  → Success toast: "Analysis complete — 7.4/10 · 14 equations extracted"
```

If the Research Analyser API is not running:
- Extension shows: "Research Analyser server not running. Start it?"
- On confirm: runs `researchAnalyser.startServer` (see §6.1 below)
- Retries the API call after 5 seconds

### 6.1 Start Server — Environment Bootstrap

`researchAnalyser.startServer` handles first-time setup automatically:

**First invocation (no venv found):**
1. Searches for an existing Python venv at these locations (in order):
   - `~/.researchanalyser/venv` — persistent, shared with the macOS launcher
   - `<workspace>/.venv312/bin/uvicorn`
   - `<workspace>/.venv/bin/uvicorn`
   - `<workspace>/venv/bin/uvicorn`
2. If none found, creates `~/.researchanalyser/venv`:
   - Discovers Python 3.10+ via login-shell PATH (`command -v python3.12 …`)
   - `python -m venv ~/.researchanalyser/venv`
   - `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - `pip install -r <workspace>/requirements.txt` (falls back to core server packages if no `requirements.txt`)
3. Starts `uvicorn research_analyser.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
4. Shows a terminal task (`Research Analyser — First-time Setup`) so the user can monitor progress
5. Polls for `/health` readiness for up to **10 minutes** (package installs can take time)

**Subsequent invocations:**
- Detects existing venv via `uvicorn` binary presence
- Runs `pip install --quiet -r requirements.txt` (or core package list) to ensure all packages are present/up-to-date — safe no-op if everything is already installed, and fixes any missing packages added since the venv was created (e.g. `sse-starlette`)
- Starts server; polls for up to **30 seconds**

**Shell execution:** All commands run via `zsh -l -c` (login shell) so Homebrew, pyenv, and conda are on PATH without any manual configuration.

**Venv reuse:** The `~/.researchanalyser/venv` directory persists across workspace changes and VS Code restarts. Delete it to force a clean reinstall.

## 7. Configuration

All settings under `researchAnalyser.*`:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `apiUrl` | string | `"http://localhost:8000"` | Research Analyser API base URL |
| `autoLoadLatestReport` | boolean | `true` | On activation, load the most recent report from the API |
| `reportSearchPaths` | string[] | `["./output", "~/ResearchAnalyserOutput"]` | Directories to search for `analysis_report.json` |
| `hoverEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable equation hover on all language files |
| `hoverLanguages` | string[] | `["python","typescript","javascript","cpp","rust"]` | Languages to activate hover for |
| `inlineDecorationsEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Show equation previews as inline editor decorations |
| `katexFontSize` | string | `"1.1em"` | KaTeX font size for equation rendering |
| `specFileGlob` | string | `"**/spec.md,**/*_spec.md"` | File patterns for the custom spec renderer |
| `insertFormat` | enum | `"comment"` | Default equation insert format: `comment` \| `docstring` \| `raw` |

---

## 8. Implementation Tracking (Coverage Decorator)

Developers annotate code with `// @implements §3.2` (any language comment style).
The extension:
1. Scans workspace for `@implements §X.Y` annotations
2. Crosses them against the loaded report's sections
3. Shows coverage in the sidebar:
   ```
   ▸ Spec Sections  (6 total, 4 covered)
       ✓ §3.1  View-Adaptive Curve Model
       ✓ §3.2  Per-View Lightness Correction
       ✓ §4.1  Training Loss
       ✓ §4.2  Dataset Preparation
       ○ §5.1  Ablation Study         ← not yet implemented
       ○ §5.2  Quantitative Results   ← not yet implemented
   ```
4. Gutter icons in covered files: green check at lines with `@implements`
5. Command `researchAnalyser.markImplements` inserts `// @implements §…` with a section picker

---

## 9. Key Equations Format in spec.md

When Research Analyser generates `spec.md`, equations are embedded in a standard block:

```markdown
## Equations

### eq-1 · §Introduction
**Label:** Eq. (1)
**Section:** Introduction

$$
y = f_\theta(x)
$$

> Image-to-output mapping where $\theta$ are the learned parameters.

---

### eq-3 · §Method
**Label:** Eq. (3)
**Section:** 3.1 Proposed Method

$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{photo} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{reg}
$$

> Combined photometric and regularisation loss.
  $\lambda_1 = 0.8$, $\lambda_2 = 0.2$ in all experiments.

---
```

This format is:
- Renderable by standard Markdown previewers (GitHub, VS Code built-in)
- Parseable by the extension (extract equation ID, label, section, LaTeX, description)
- Searchable in the Equation Picker

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion |
|---|-----------|
| AC-1 | Loading an `analysis_report.json` populates the sidebar within 500 ms |
| AC-2 | Hovering over a known symbol shows the equation card within 200 ms |
| AC-3 | Hovering over an unknown symbol shows nothing (no false positives) |
| AC-4 | Opening `spec.md` renders all `$$...$$` blocks as KaTeX (not raw strings) |
| AC-5 | Equation Picker lists all equations and inserts the selected one at cursor |
| AC-6 | `⇧⌘R` triggers analysis; progress notification updates at least every 5 s |
| AC-7 | If API is offline, extension shows a "Start server?" prompt |
| AC-8 | Coverage sidebar correctly counts `@implements` annotations and shows uncovered sections |
| AC-9 | All KaTeX rendering works fully offline (no CDN requests) |
| AC-10 | Extension activates in < 300 ms on startup (lazy-loads heavy providers) |
| AC-11 | First "Start Server" creates `~/.researchanalyser/venv`, installs all requirements, and starts uvicorn — no manual pip commands required |
| AC-12 | Subsequent "Start Server" reuses the existing venv and ensures all packages from `requirements.txt` are installed before starting uvicorn |
